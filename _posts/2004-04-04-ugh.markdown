Dad got tickets for opening day today which is whatever but at least that means he won't be hassling me about schoolwork all afternoon. It was fun when we were kids and all but baseball is soooo slowwwwwwww. I don't get it.

J wanted to go to CCAS last night but L was being really annoying about that guy she has been seeing and didn't want to run into him. He is friends with Thinking Toys I guess. I can't even remember his name, whatever. We tried to get her to just drive us there and we could figure out a ride home, but she was moody. That place smells weird anyway, and there's nothing to do between sets except walk over to the McDonalds for coffee.
