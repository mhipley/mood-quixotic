        <title>whatever</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone forgot there was a quiz in calc today and then everyone complained. I mean why bother just take the quiz, if everyone does badly Q won’t put it towards our final grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday in homeroom &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; was flipping throught the CD insert for the Blur Best of, kind of funny. She asked if I knew Gorillaz (“with a z”) too. She said they’re that song from that fucking Ice Breakers commercial! So creepy. I tried getting the song off Limewire last night but it sounded a lot different? I guess the one in the commercial is a remix or something. I tried searching again for a remix but the thing I downloaded was just crazy frog (why is everything always crazy frog?), and then A complained he needed to use the internet for homework and I had to get off. I guess I could ask her about it again but that’s kind of weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep wishing I would just break my arm or something and could skip school and, mostly, tennis. As long as I take the AP tests it doens’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A was such a little creep at the game and whined the whole time, but whatever at least the Orioles won. I can’t believe the shit he gets away with. He got dad to get him a hat which he’ll never wear, he just wanted to get something. He got a pennant too and already dumped it on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t finish my essay but emailed it to myself and finished in the library at the break. So lucky having English last period. I said I was sick and skipped tennis. I don’t think mom or dad would care if I quit, it’s not like my gear is new or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m finally listening to the CD L gave me with all her mp3s and it’s pretty terrible. MXPX is the worst, how do they even have so many albums! If I quit tennis I could just get a job and not have to rely on Limewire or whatever. I still can’t figure out what the song in that Ice Breakers ad is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ugh</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dad got tickets for opening day today which is whatever but at least that means he won’t be hassling me about schoolwork all afternoon. It was fun when we were kids and all but baseball is soooo slowwwwwwww. I don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J wanted to go to CCAS last night but L was being really annoying about that guy she has been seeing and didn’t want to run into him. He is friends with Thinking Toys I guess. I can’t even remember his name, whatever. We tried to get her to just drive us there and we could figure out a ride home, but she was moody. That place smells weird anyway, and there’s nothing to do between sets except walk over to the McDonalds for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>hi mom!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sooooooo…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mom found my journal and gave me shit about it, as though I was even drinking at Kelly’s party! She won’t even admit that she read it, but why else would she grill me about last weekend? Whatever, she doesn’t know how to use the internet, so I just started this journal here. Ugh I can’t stand the word “blog,” who even says that? Also figured out how to set up a webcam so I can keep an eye on my room. Well, I can keep an eye on it from the computers in the library when I’m in there for break. I still haven’t figured out how to make it record. Do you need a url for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so done with tennis. G is such an asshole and made us run in the mud for an hour yesterday. He doesn’t even really know how to play so he just makes us do drills, what a waste. S offered to give me a ride after practice but then gave me a hard time about mud in her car. Why were we even friends? Just because we live near each other? I just want it to be summer and only play for fun. School is miserable enough without sticking around for an hour extra every other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s assignment for English is ok, I think I’ll probably like Huckleberry Finn, but I don’t even want to think about the AP exam. It’s not fun to read when we just end up having to write some bullshit essay. It’s not even like we get to think about the books, we just have to use the right format. Mark Twain would probably just quit if somebody told him he had to have 3 body paragraphs and a good conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
